# Designing a Messaging App

## Overview
Designing a real-time messaging application like WhatsApp or Slack.

## Key Components
1. **User Management**: Handle user registration, login, and profile management.
2. **Message Delivery**: Real-time message delivery system.
3. **Chat Storage**: Efficient storage of chat history.
4. **Notifications**: Push notifications for new messages.
5. **Security**: End-to-end encryption for user privacy.

## Data Flow
1. User sends a message via the app.
2. The message is sent to the server.
3. The server processes and routes the message to the recipient.
4. The recipient receives a push notification.
5. The message is stored in the chat history.

## Considerations
- **Scalability**: Handle large numbers of concurrent users.
- **Reliability**: Ensure messages are not lost during transmission.
- **Security**: Implement encryption and secure transmission channels.
